General Notes About the Project.

2025-02-03
Use MySQL for a learning experience. Will likely use INNER JOIN for many-to-many system.
Databasing will be done with a MySQL docker container with a docker volume mounted to it.
- Volumes pretend to be a folder in the container. When writing is done, it automatically
puts the data in the volume.
Use a docker-compose.yml file to define how the multi-container program will work.
Use mysql.connector in Python to do stuff to the database.
- set a cursor
- tell the cursor to execute(SQL COMMAND)

ScraperManager will handle Scraper threads, ValidatorManager will handle Validator threads.
Proper shutdown of the data gathering system will be a "flush":
1. ScraperManager: Scraper operating flag will be set to False. Scraper: stops link gathering.
2. ScraperManager: Scraper standby flag will be set to False. Scraper: closes browsers.
3. ScraperManager: Scraper quit flag set to True. Scraper: All exit run_loop.
4. ValidatorManager: Starts a Validator of batch_size 1 on top of existing Validators.
5. ValidatorManager: Validator operating flag set True.
6. Validators clear validation queue, all results pushed to link queue.
7. ValidatorManager: Validator quit flag set to True. Validator: All exit run_loop.
8. ValidatorManager: Save seen_links_set
9. ScraperManager: Save link queue.
